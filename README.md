Job Management User Interface design developed with AdobeXD

Job Management is a small open-source project, without commercial intends, with the main purposes of practicing my knowledge acquired in the last years in web application development, to help me organize my search for new job opportunities and also help many friends who are also looking for a new job.

The project duration is about 4 months and I believe it is about 70% complete.

If you would like to contribute to improving this application, please contact me:
